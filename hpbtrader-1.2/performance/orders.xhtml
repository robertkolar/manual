<h1>Orders</h1>
Orders table displays a list list of orders submitted during a live or simulated strategy operation.
When the strategy triggers a new signal, a new order gets submitted and placed live to the exchange via the IB Gateway.
In case of the simulated operation the order is managed wihin the strategy simulated account and doesn't get placed to the exchange.
During the lifecycle the order passes through the multiple phases according to the order events like new, submitReq, submitted, filled, cancelReq, canceled.

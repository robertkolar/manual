<h1>Backtesting</h1>

Backtesting on the selected series and strategy is performed by selecting the series from the series table, selecting the desired
strategy by using the strategy combo box (toolbar control 19) and pressing the backtest button (toolbar button 20).
By default the strategy is tested against all available historical data for the selected series. The time range can be limited by deselecting the 'backtest all' checkbox
(toolbar control 23) and entering start end end dates (toolbar controls 21 and 22) of the backtest run.

<p>
The backtest result is displayed in the performance view similar to strategy performance view.
The strategy mode of the backtested strategy is BTEST and it is displayed in all of the performance view tables like strategy table or strategy logs table.
For detailed information about the performance view please refer to the section 'Performance'.

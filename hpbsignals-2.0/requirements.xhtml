        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to have a trading system hosted on the Collective2 site</li>
            <li>You need to have an Interactive Brokers trading account with TWS or IB Gateway running</li>
            <li>Make sure that IB is configured to accept socket connections: '<span style="color: green;">Edit--&gt;Global Configuration--&gt;API--&gt;Settings--&gt;Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients</span>'</li>
            <li>Make sure that IB setting '<span style="color: green;">Edit--&gt;Global Configuration--&gt;API--&gt;Settings--&gt;Download open orders on connection</span>' is checked</li>
            <li>Make sure that IB setting '<span style="color:green;">Edit--&gt;Global Configuration--&gt;API--&gt;Settings--&gt;Master API client ID</span>' is set to 0</li>
            <li>HPBSignals connects to IB using client id = 0, so no other IB API application can use that client id at the same time</li>
            <li>It is recommended to install the latest TWS or IB Gateway</li>
            <li>Any operating system with Java 7.x installed is supported. You can download Java <a class="blue" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank">here</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 40px;">Important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HPBSignals listens for orders entered through IB directly (trading window, options trader, etc.) and also for orders entered through third party trading applications connected to IB (such as NinjaTrader, BracketTrader, etc).</li>
            <li>Only one instance of HPBSignals can connect to a single IB Gateway or TWS at the same time </li>
            <li>A single instance of HPBSignals can send Collective2 signals to a single trading system chosen upon login</li>
            <li>Multiple instances of HPBSignals (with independent databases) can connect to multiple instances of IB and send signals to multiple C2 systems</li>
            <li>When HPBSignals is restarted, a different trading system can be chosen from the list of available trading systems (if multiple systems are available)</li>
            <li>If there are open orders in IB and they have not been submitted to Collective2 system yet, they will automatically be submitted to Collective2 when HPBSignals first connects to IB</li>
        </ul>

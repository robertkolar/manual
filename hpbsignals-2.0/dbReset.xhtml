        <h1>Database Reset</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Database can be reset, but this operation is not needed nor recommended in a normal use. All data is permanently deleted and all outstanding IB orders are getting automatically retransmitted to C2 platform.</li>
            <li>Database reset is triggered by clicking Database--&gt;Reset DB menu item</li>
            <li>Database reset should be used with caution since all data is cleared and cannot be recovered unless a backup has been made before the reset</li>
        </ul>
